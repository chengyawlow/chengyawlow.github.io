Hi, I'm Cheng Yaw Low (Cheng), a research associate with the [Data Science Group, Institute for Basic Science, Republic of Korea](https://ds.ibs.re.kr/). My research primarily focuses on computer vision and biometrics, specializing in biometric recognition, biometric template protection, and synthetic biometric data generation. More recently, I have begun a new and exciting project in the field of forest biometrics, exploring innovative ways to apply my expertise in data science to environmental studies.
